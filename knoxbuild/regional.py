"""Build the town the way the town is actually built.

KnoxMap's materials and storey counts come from the game's own Knox County -
weatherboard houses one and two storeys tall, mostly. That is right for the
map's native Kentucky and wrong for most of the world the survey can name. A
Chinese city is not clapboard and shutters: it is masonry and render, flat
roofs with air-conditioners on them, self-built houses of three and four
storeys and walk-up blocks behind compound walls.

This module answers two questions without touching anything else in the
pipeline: *where in the world is this map*, read from the script its own
buildings' names are written in (and from the bounding box when the survey
names nothing), and *what that place builds with* - a pool of house styles
composed from the catalog's own verified entries, plus the storey tables the
region's housing actually runs to.

The style composition is deliberately conservative. Rather than inventing
tile references, a regional style is the catalog's own entry with its peaked
roof laid flat and its shutters left off; every tile in it is a tile the
catalog already shipped. Detection never guesses a region from an ambiguous
place: a town whose names are in Han script is Chinese-built, one with kana
or hangul in them is Japanese or Korean, and one written in anything else
builds the way the game does. `arch_style` in the settings forces the issue
either way.
