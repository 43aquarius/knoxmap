"""Real interiors from OSM indoor=room data (renderer + knoxbuild.layout).

Run from the KnoxMap folder:  python -m unittest discover tests
No network, no files.

Two halves: renderer._buildings_geojson attaches each mapped room to the
building it stands in, and layout.build_plan cuts the ground floor along
those rooms instead of guessing. A building surveyed room by room - a
school's classrooms, an office's rooms round its core - keeps that plan.
