"""Which cells of a compiled map are out of date, so a recompile does only those.

Compiling a big town is most of an hour, and a change to one street used to cost
all of it: clear_stale (compile_map.py) can only compare file times, and a
build rewrites every building's file, so everything looked newer than the lots.

This keeps, after a compile that finished cleanly, a fingerprint of everything
each 300-tile cell of the world was compiled from:

  terrain  the ground and vegetation pixels. These become the cell's .tmx.
  content  the cell's entry in the .pzw (its buildings and zones), the .tbx
           files those buildings are, and the zombie spawn map over the cell.
           These, with the terrain, become the lot files.

and one fingerprint of what applies to the whole world (the rules the bitmaps
are converted by, the compiler, the world's size and origin). Next time, cells
whose fingerprints are unchanged keep their lots; the rest, and their
neighbours (a lot file is 256 tiles, a cell 300, and blends and buildings
reach across an edge), are deleted so WorldEd makes them again. When anything
global changed, or there is no record, nothing is trusted and the older
file-time rule decides.
